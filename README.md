## Hi! 👋

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science concentrating in Business and Industrial Analytics. I'm currently working as an Associate in renewable energy consulting, where I support research and quantitative analytics that will be used for the planning of decarbonization strategies and facilitating the transition to clean energy. 

I'm passionate about leveraging my skills to make a positive impact, particularly in the areas of sustainability and education.🍄 In my free time, I enjoy being around nature, picking up new skills, traveling, diving into a book, and cooking and eating good food. Always down to chat and open to receiving food/book recommendations! Feel free to reach out to me at dewisandra@berkeley.edu.
